## Torque visualization examples using cartodb.js library

Two torque visualization examples where generated using the [cartodb.js](https://github.com/ramiroaznar/cartodb.js) library. The data were obtained from previous programs[1] and imported as CartoDB tables. The code is based on two different sources. One from a repository of Daniel Carri√≥n [2] and the other from a post (and other repositories) of Andrew Hill [3].

# caraacara_torque.html

The first torque visualization is based on the example obtained from this repository [4]. It shows some of the tweets tweeted during *the last Spanish general elections debate* between the two major parties. Blue dots represent tweets that cited Mariano Rajoy, and red dots represent tweets that cited Pedro Sanchez.

# accorddeparis_torque.html

The second torque visualization is based on the example obtained from this repository [5]. It shows some of the tweets after the sign of the *Paris agreement* concerning climate change. Green dots are positive reactions, red ones are negative and gray ones neutral.
